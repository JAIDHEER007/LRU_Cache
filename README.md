Cache Simulator Project


Project Objective
This project aims to design and implement a cache simulator that models the behavior of set-associative caches using the Least Recently Used (LRU) replacement policy. The simulator provides an opportunity to understand the internal mechanisms of CPU caches and the design process in computer architecture. By simulating the memory access patterns from trace files, the project enables experimentation with various cache configurations, such as size and associativity, to analyze their impact on cache miss rates.
